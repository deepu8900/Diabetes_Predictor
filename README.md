# Diabetes_Predictor
# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a person is diabetic based on medical data.

## 📊 Dataset
- **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset**

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 🔍 Features Used
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## 📈 Results
- Model: SVM (Support Vector Classifier)
- Accuracy: ~78% on training data

## 📂 Files
- `Diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Full notebook code
- `model.pkl`: Trained model file (for reuse)
- `requirements.txt`: All dependencies

## 🧠 How to Use
Clone this repo and run the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.  
You'll be prompted to enter patient data manually, and the model will predict the diabetes outcome.
